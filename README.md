# Responsive Portfolio

My main objective of designming this project is to check the simple responsive portfolio website. For this project, I have used three different HTML files (Home page-index.html, Portfolio page-portfolio.html & Contact page-contact.html). Besides, I have also used some of my images and a stylesheet file (style.css). Most of the codes were extracted from https://getbootstrap.com/ after reviewing. Also, our week-2 class activities and notes were very helpful to complete this project.

As it was my very first time using Bootstrap, I definitely encountered numerous issues while using it. The bootstrap grid system , rows and columns have been challenging concepts grasp. However, utilizing the nav-bars and other many bootstrap features served as a Aha moment for me. As I learn more, I am very confident I will be able to better utilize bootstrap features to my advantage.
